# IDEA 1: a text based adventure game that allows the user to accept or decline items into his inventory.
# The inventory will be linked to mariaDB and called upon by the database driver in the code below.
# Coded by: Mohamed, Jeferson, Andrea, MD Shamiul.

# TO DO:
# + Combat check command (DONE!) Combat just happens at the final, we could add more if wanted in other rooms
# + Item check command (DONE!)
# - Adding items (So far just three items in three location and the user decide if accept them, items cannot be
#               appended, or I could not figure a way to have more than one item)
# + Adding encounters (DONE!) the final encounter
# + reloading the game upon death (DONE!)
# + Adding different location names (DONE!)
# + Wiping text when reloading. (DONE!)
# + Check for Lower cases. (DONE!)
# + All rooms are working as they should following the flow chart (DONE!)
# - SQL check inventory for the user ( DONE! Three reminders of the current item in Maze, Crossroad and Crosswalk)
# + Adding the option  if the player wants to play again (DONE!)
# + Primary Key of The table Current game modified, now PK is just ID (DONE!)
# + The coded was shortened for non-necessaries Loops and extra lines (DONE!)
# + Added functions: inventory(item) and check_inventory() (DONE!)
# + Allowing the user to see their current location (DONE!)
# + Putting gold collected in a new sql table called score (DONE!)
# - Adding gold earned in the game as score
# + Add line spacing (DONE!)
# - Draw items: Skulls, Sword, etc...
# - Color of the text

# The game:
